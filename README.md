# Loan Default Risk Prediction

## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview
This project simulates and models loan default risk using a synthetic dataset. It demonstrates how machine learning models like logistic regression or XGBoost can be applied to predict the likelihood of default based on borrower and loan features.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
1,000 simulated loan applicants with features including:
- Age
- Income
- Loan amount and term
- Credit score
- Employment years and self-employment status
- Region
- Default label (0 = repaid, 1 = defaulted)

## ðŸ”§ Tools Used
- Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn)
- Data visualization (matplotlib, seaborn)
- Modeling (logistic regression, random forest, XGBoost)

## ðŸ§ª Objectives
- Build a binary classification model to predict default risk
- Explore feature importance
- Evaluate model performance (accuracy, precision, recall, ROC-AUC)

## ðŸ“‚ Files
- `data/loan_default_dataset.csv`: Synthetic training dataset
- `notebook.ipynb`: Full modeling workflow (to be created)
